Four students entered MESA&rsquo;s National Engineering\n              Design Challenge (NEDC) with the idea of creating a system to monitor student movements in school\n              to improve the administration&rsquo;s attendance tracking abilities. The system will improve accountability\n              of students being in the right classes at the right time and will benefit the school by ensuring\n              attendance-based funding is maintained satisfactorily. As our team progressed through competitions,\n              many teachers gave positive feedback regarding our system, and quite a few teachers commented that\n              they would love to have the system implemented in their school, including our very own teachers here\n              at Santa Teresa. Thus, Innexgo LLC was born.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Innexgo LLC now strives to help schools and school districts tackle attendance inconsistencies. We are\n              committed to collaborating with community and education leaders to optimize our attendance system\n              to the localized needs of all clients. As we move forward, Innexgo LLC aims to bring our technology to\n              other academic institutions across many communities in the United States.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Furthermore, Innexgo LLC is expanding operations to assist schools and school districts beyond attendance.\n              Currently, we are innovating our new platform for exam creation, Innexgo Exams, on top of continuing to improve\n              our flagship attendance services, Innexgo Hours. \n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </Container>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n
